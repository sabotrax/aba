An auto battler in FastBasic for the Atari 8-bits

## Features

Be warned - this is pre alpha code and I haven't touched BASIC in 35 years.  

* ATASCII only, no graphics. Output is mostly for debugging purpose. 
* No interaction. But you can watch the battle unfold.
* A weak priest with a moderate healing spell is fighting against three NPCs in a row.  
  The priest will heal himself if he has enough mana.
  He has an artifact which lowers the enemy's hit chance.  
  The first NPC is a dog, the second is a sturdy dog with higher defense and a DOT,
  the last NPC is an aggressive dog with a stronger attack.

### Artifacts

* Endless Sandbag - lowers the enemy's hit chance.  
  You reach into the bag, aim for the eyes of the terrible monster and throw the sand..
* Steady Shield - blocks some of the incoming damage.  
  There may be better, but there sure a much worse..
